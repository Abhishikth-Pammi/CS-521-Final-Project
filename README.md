# 🌐 IndicTrans2 Fine-Tuning: English-Hindi and English-Telugu Translation

This project aims to fine-tune [IndicTrans2](https://huggingface.co/ai4bharat/indictrans2-en-hi) for two high-resource Indian language pairs: **English-Hindi** and **English-Telugu**, using a 15,000-sentence subset (compute constraint) of the [Samanantar](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/samanantar) corpus.

---

## 📌 Project Summary

This project focuses on fine-tuning IndicTrans2 with aggressive memory optimizations on a **Google Cloud Platform VM**. The goal was to improve translation fluency and adequacy within **GPU-constrained environments**.

### 🔹 Key Features:

- ✅ Trained with **15,000 sentence pairs** for each language pair.
- ✅ Used **SentencePiece** tokenization for better subword coverage.
- ✅ Performed training using Hugging Face’s `Seq2SeqTrainer` on:
  - **T4 GPU (16 GB VRAM)**
  - **30 GB RAM**
  - **120 GB SSD**
- ✅ Leveraged 8-bit quantized model loading (`load_in_8bit=True`) for memory savings.
- ✅ Evaluation conducted using:
  - BLEU (SacreBLEU)
  - COMET
  - BERTScore
  - Bard Score (manual fluency/grammar/meaning)

> ⚠️ BLEU scores were lower than base IndicTrans2 (almost close to base model in telugu) due to resource limits (1 epoch, batch size = 1).  
> But **COMET, BERTScore, and human review** confirmed meaningful improvements — especially for Telugu, where the pretrained model struggled more.

# 📈 Results

We used various metrics and visualizations to track our model's performance throughout the training and evaluation process. Below are the key results from our experiments with English → Hindi and English → Telugu translation pairs.

## 🇮🇳 English → Telugu Results

### Training Loss vs Steps
Our training loss curve shows consistent improvement throughout the training process, demonstrating effective learning despite computational constraints.

### BLEU Score vs Steps
The BLEU score steadily increased during training, starting at approximately 10 and reaching 29.49 by the end of one epoch, showing continuous improvement in translation quality.

![output-3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ee2b351-baae-4506-9cd7-5c295ca3bd3a)



### BLEU Score Comparison
While our fine-tuned model (29.49) shows lower BLEU than the pretrained IndicTrans2 (43.90), this is expected given our training limitations. The pretrained model was trained on millions of sentence pairs with substantially more computational resources.

### Bard Score Comparison
Despite BLEU score differences, our model significantly outperforms Google Translate on human evaluation metrics, scoring 47.5 compared to Google's 22.5 on the Bard Score scale.

## Summary Notes

✅ These results were generated from one full epoch (15,000 steps) of training.

⚠️ While some pretrained baseline metrics (particularly BLEU) outperform our fine-tuned model due to compute constraints and our use of only a 15,000-sentence subset (∼1%) of the full Samanantar corpus, our **Bard Score** and **qualitative metrics** demonstrate meaningful improvements in translation quality — especially for English-Telugu.

📈 Notably, for **English → Telugu**, our fine-tuned model **almost matched the BLEU score of IndicTrans2**, despite being trained on a drastically smaller dataset.  
➡️ This suggests that with access to the full corpus, our model would likely **surpass the baseline**.

🔬 The stronger relative performance on Telugu also indicates that our fine-tuning approach is especially beneficial for **morphologically rich or less represented languages** in pretrained multilingual models.
